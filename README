How to invoke my program:
To compile and run the program you will need to have Qt(version 5.3) and qmake(version 3.0) installed.
Other versions are not guaranteed to work due to they differ in configurations of QtWidgets.

Note: Step 1-3 can be skipped as Makefile has already been provided
Step1: generate the .pro file.
       run: qmake -project
Step2: modify the pro file. Add two lines to the generated .pro file:
       QT += opengl widgets
       CONFIG += C++11
Step3: generate the Makefile by running: qmake
Step4: build the program with Makefile and run the executable.


This is a 3D Tetris game, with a focus on Graphics/OpenGL and UI.
Aside from playing the game, users get to do translation/rotation/scaling with the game scene.
The game logic part of the code has been provided by University of Waterloo.
