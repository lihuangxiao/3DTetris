How to invoke my program:
To compile and run the program you will need to have Qt(version 5.3) and qmake(version 3.0) installed. Other versions are not guaranteed to work due to they differ in configureations of QtWidgets.
Step1: build the pro file. check the you are running correct version of qmake by running "qmake -v"
       run: "qmake -project"
Step2: modify the pro file. Open the generated .pro file, add two lines to it:
       QT += opengl widgets
       CONFIG += C++11
Step3: generate the Makefile by typing: qmake
(step 1-3 can be skipped as Makefile has already been provided.)
Step4: build the program with Makefile and run the executable.


This is a 3D Tetris game, with a focus on object transformation and object rendering.
Users get to do translation/rotation/scaling with the game scene.
The actual game is provided by University of Waterloo.
