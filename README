How to invoke my program:
To compile and run the program you will need to have Qt(version 5.3) and qmake(version 3.0) installed.
Other versions are not guaranteed to work due to they differ in configurations of QtWidgets.

Note: Step 2-4 can be skipped as Makefile has already been provided
Step1: set up environment (the example works for Ubuntu):
       part 1: set up mesa (OpenGL 3.0)
       sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install freeglut3
       sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
       sudo apt-get install binutils-gold
       sudo apt-get install g++ cmake
       sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
       sudo apt-get install g++
       sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
       sudo apt-get install build-essential
       sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev libglm-dev
       part 2: set up Qt:
       https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/
       you can install all versions of Qt that are 5.0+
Step2: generate the .pro file.
       navigate to src directory, run: qmake -project
Step3: modify the pro file. Add two lines to the generated .pro file:
       QT += opengl widgets
       CONFIG += C++11
Step4: generate the Makefile by running: qmake
Step5: build the program with Makefile and run the executable.


This is a 3D Tetris game, with a focus on Graphics/OpenGL and UI.
Aside from playing the game, users get to do translation/rotation/scaling with the game scene.
The game logic part of the code has been provided by University of Waterloo.
